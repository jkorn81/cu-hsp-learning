# Outline 

Week 02, 07/05 - 07/11, Day 9

**_Thursday *(Pre-Session Readings and Assignments)*:_**

- Prepare for class by individually writing down ideas for projects that can be conducted using some of the machine learning and deep learning techniques we discussed so far. *(... at least think of 3 solutions that can be developed)* 

**_Thursday *(morning session ~ 9:10am to 11:00am)*:_** 

- Course Project Discussion and Commissioning of Individual Group Components to contribute to a distributed machine learning system. 
- Discuss research and application ideas as a whole: 

    - The problem should consist of multiple components that require machine learning to assist in the decision process. *(i.e. building a distributed machine learning system that consists of two layers to decide whether to buy and sell an asset.)* 
    - Two machine learning models are required at minimum to support such a system. We will focus on conducting the research for the individual components on the project idea that the class agrees on. 
    - We will divide into groups who will perform the research on the selected components. 
    - Each group will present their results and the class as a whole will discuss the work. 
    
- Review the project documentation contained in the course github repo @ folder labeled [10_project](https://github.com/jkorn81/cu-hsp-learning/tree/main/10_project).

**_Thursday *(afternoon session ~ 1:10pm to 3:00pm)*:_** 

- Reporting Techniques:

    - *(Github)*
    
        - Create an account. 
        - Create a repository *(repo)* for your course work and load any file you would like. 
        - We will discuss best practices for managing your repos. 

**_Thursday *(Post-Session Readings and Assignments)*:_**

- Keep writing down ideas that you'd like to pitch to the class and associate those ideas with a neat project name.
