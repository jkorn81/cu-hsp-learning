- Send a copy of your knitted `assignment3` to the instructor before the start of the morning session.

**_Monday *(morning session ~ 9:10am to 11:00am)*:_** 

- Application and Reporting of Classical Machine Learning Algorithms for Supervised Problems using Structured Data

    - Architect and train supervised classification and regression *(time series)* models in R and Python.
    
        - Evaluate the performance of the trained model states.
        - Discuss Use Cases for Potential Machine Learning Project Ideas.

**_Monday *(afternoon session ~ 1:10pm to 3:00pm)*:_** 

- Application and Reporting of Classical Machine Learning Algorithms for Unsupervised Problems using Structured Data
 
    - Architect and train unsupervised classification models in R and Python.
    
        - Evaluate the performance of the trained model states.
        - Discuss Use Cases for Potential Machine Learning Project Ideas.

**_Monday *(Post-Session Readings and Assignments)*:_**

- Prepare for tomorrow as discussed in class.
