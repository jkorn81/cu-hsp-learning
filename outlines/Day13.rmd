# Outline 

Week 03, 07/12 - 07/18, Day 13

**_Wednesday *(Pre-Session Readings and Assignments)*:_**

- Access the supporting scripts in the following github repo you cloned yesterday @ [cu-hsp-learning](https://github.com/jkorn81/cu-hsp-learning).

**_Wednesday *(morning session ~ 9:10am to 11:00am)*:_** 

 - Compile the Group work into final presentations. *(I suggest using two reporting files, (1) quick presentation and (2) a detailed report such as [report example](https://github.com/jkorn81/cu-hsp-learning/blob/main/09_reporting/uml.report.rmd). Your presentation can merely reference the accompanying report allowing you to focus on the interpretation of the results.)*

**_Wednesday *(afternoon session ~ 1:10pm to 3:00pm)*:_** 

- *Continue...* Compile the Group work into presentations. 

**_Wednesday *(Post-Session Readings and Assignments)*:_**

- Prepare for tomorrow and complete any remaining work on your group's project component and presentation.
