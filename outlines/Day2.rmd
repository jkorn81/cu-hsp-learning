**_Tuesday *(Pre-Session Readings and Assignments)*:_**

- Access the course github repo @ [cu-hsp-learning](https://github.com/jkorn81/cu-hsp-learning) to connect to all the data sources will be using for class @ [data](https://github.com/jkorn81/cu-hsp-learning/tree/main/data). 

    - Clone the repo and store the root somewhere easy to access. *(I suggest storing it on your desktop for the duration of the course.)*

**_Tuesday *(morning session ~ 9:10am to 11:00am)*:_**

- Continued... Introduction to big data discussion. 

    - Unstructured *(Text, Image, Video, Speech, etc.) *

**_Tuesday *(afternoon session ~ 1:10pm to 3:00pm)*_**

- [Introduction to machine learning](https://github.com/jkorn81/cu-hsp-learning/tree/main/03_intro.machine_learning) discussion. 

    - Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning. 
    - Classification, Regression, Time Series and Clustering Problems. 
    - [Classical Machine Learning](https://github.com/jkorn81/cu-hsp-learning/tree/main/07_classical_ml) *(Linear Models, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, etc.)* *(sturctured data focused)*
    - [Deep Learning](https://github.com/jkorn81/cu-hsp-learning/tree/main/08_deep_learning) *(Tensorflow and Keras in Python and R)* *(image, text, and structured data focused)*
    
**_Tuesday *(Post-Session Readings and Assignments)*:_**

- Watch the short video @ [The future of Machine Learning and its Impact on Your Everyday Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjVIQUE8Sgk) *(3 minutes 55 seconds)* and write down some ideas of how you could use machine learning in your everyday life. *(... be prepared to discuss in class.)*
