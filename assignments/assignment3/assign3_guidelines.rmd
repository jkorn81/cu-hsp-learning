# Instructions:

**Step 1:** Open the rmarkdown file labeled `assign3.rmd` @ [assignment3](https://github.com/jkorn81/cu-hsp-learning/tree/main/assignments/assignment3)

**Step 2:** Revise line #3 with your name. *(... this is the yaml header in an rmarkdown file. We will discuss this more later on.)*

- The rmarkdown file you will be knitting will output into an htlm_document. 

**Step 3:** Address the questions providing your responses in each empty code chunk.

- Provide a response in each each question. 
- Each response should be completed in the associated code chunk nested below the question. 
- If the question requires a written response I want you to input a stored variable containing a string in the code chunk and print it.

:::: {..lstset data-latex=""}
**_.i.e._** 
```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
example = "Here is an example of storing a variable as a string and printing it from within the code chunk."
print(example)
```

**Step 4:** When you have addressed all the questions providing a response in each of the empty codie chunks you can knit the file by clicking on the `Knit` button. 

*Note, a html document will generate in your working directory.*

**Step 5:** Submit the generated html file to the instructor.
