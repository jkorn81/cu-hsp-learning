**Course Title:** *"BIG DATA, MACHINE LEARNING, AND THEIR REAL WORLD APPLICATIONS"*

**Course Overview:** 

This course introduces students with an overview of big data, machine learning, and their real-world applications. 
Students focus on the strategic use of data and the innovative technologies utilized to derive actionable business insights. 
Develop the *"Analytical Mindset"* and start thinking data-centric to solve real-world problems. 
Students are introduced to R and Python programming language to import/export, manipulate, transform, and visualize data. 
Also, learn to perform basic data analytics such as statistical summaries. 
The main focus of the course is to develop students to train and evaluate machine learning models for structured classification, regression, time series and clustering problems and unstructured classification problems. 
Learn to handle models with both structured and unstructured data using various supervised and unsupervised classical machine learning algorithms and deep learning algorithms. 
Students will be also introduced to the idea of distributed machine learning systems.
