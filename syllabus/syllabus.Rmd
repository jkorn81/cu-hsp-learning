# Course Policies {-}

## Participation and Attendance

You are expected to complete all assigned readings, attend all class sessions, and engage with others in online discussions. 
Your participation will require that you answer questions, defend your point of view, and challenge the points of view of others. 
If you need to miss a class for any reason, please discuss the absence with me in advance. Class attendance is mandatory. Any disruptive behavior will not be tolerated.

## Class Etiquette

To ensure the learning environment is optimal, all students should adhere to the following "netiquette" principles during the online class:

-	Log into Zoom in enough time to get set up and ready to commence when the class begins. Test your audio and ensure there are no technical problems.
-	Participate in the class from a quiet location with minimal distractions.
-	Be visible via your webcam during the entire class, and dress in classroom-appropriate attire.
-	Actively participate via mic, online polling, responding in chat, etc.
-	Be prepared by completing readings and offline activities.
-	Communicate with all fellow students and the instructor respectfully; share perspectives and relevant examples.

## Late Work

All assignments should be submitted by the due date noted in the course syllabus. Late submissions require advance notice and permission from the instructor.

## Citation & Submission

All written assignments must cite sources using [citation format] and be submitted to the course website (not via email). Plagiarism, whether intentional or unintentional, will result in dismissal from the program.

# School and Program Policies {-}

## Student Assessment

Columbia's Precollege Programs for High School Students are academically rigorous; they do not carry college credit, however, nor are they graded. Upon successful completion of the program, students receive an official Columbia University Certification of Participation and written evaluations from their instructors.

Students are evaluated on the basis of the effort they put in, their progress over the duration of the class, and their potential for future work in the pertinent field and in college. 

Successful participation is determined by the instructors in consultation with program administration. Attendance, class participation, satisfactory completion of assignments and adherence to the program's community standards are all considered as part of the evaluation process.

Class attendance is carefully monitored. Students must attend all classes unless they are ill. A student who misses multiple class sessions may not receive a Certification of Participation even if those absences are excused.

Columbia University takes matters of intellectual integrity very seriously. 
Plagiarism is not tolerated. 
Plagiarism includes, but is not limited to, submitting work done by another person or purchased from any source; failure to document ideas found in sources, whether print or electronic, with appropriate notes and bibliographical references; failure to enclose borrowed phrases or sentences within quotation marks; and turning in the same assignment for two courses without advance permission from both teachers.
Plagiarism, whether intentional or unintentional, will result in dismissal from the program. Students who are unsure about the proper presentation of their work should consult their course instructor. 

## Class Participation

Class attendance is mandatory. A student who misses multiple class sessions will not receive a Certification of Participation, even if those absences are excused. 
Unexcused absences can lead to dismissal from the program.

Students are expected to engage seriously in their courses through both class participation and completion of assigned work. Disruptive behavior will not be tolerated.

## Community Standards

The [Community Standards](https://courseworks2.columbia.edu/courses/119910/files/8358981/download?wrap=1are) designed to ensure the safety and well-being of the students and the integrity of the University. 
They are strictly enforced and failure to abide by them results in dismissal from the program, normally on the first offense.

The determination as to whether a student has violated the Community Standards is made by program staff, instructors, and administrators.

Students who are dismissed from the program do not receive evaluation letters or Certifications of Participation. 
No portion of the program cost will be refunded to a student who has been dismissed.

**_Monday *(morning session ~ 9:10am to 11:00am)*:_**


- Final Commission of the project and initial construction of the project components. 

- Discuss the initial steps to conducting machine learning research in a group. 

    - Step 1: Delegate the goal of group. *(What is the aim for the component of the distributed machine learning system that your group was tasked?)* 
    - Step 2: Set a plan to conduct the research. *(Each individual in your group should have defined tasks to complete to contribute to the overall goal of the group.)* and *(I suggest breaking into sub-groups within your group so that a pair can work on one problem together.)*
    - Step 3: Create a github repo in one of the groups githubs and provide access to all group members. *(A cloud based enviroment is important to utilize in remote based work. We will use the repo to manage pushes in your groups code and also track issues throughout the development. Think of it as home base for your group to share files.)*
    - Step 4: Each group will divide into Zoom Meetings and to build thier component of the distributed machine learning system as comissioned by the class *(in a majority vote)*. *(Make sure to share with the instructor the zoom invite link.)*

**_Monday *(Post-Session Readings and Assignments)*:_**

- Work on your group project components. *(Make sure the tasks are divided equally among the group members.)*

- To help you should make a simple text file that contains tasks for each group member to complete to accomplish the overall goal. *(... I suggest posting it on the github repo for the project, so you can track the completion of tasks with notes.)*
